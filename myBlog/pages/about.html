            <h1>Who am I</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Furkan. I graduated in Computer Programming and I’m currently focusing on improving myself in software development. I work with Swift for mobile applications and use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web projects.

In my daily life, I’m passionate about technology, coding, and continuous learning. I also enjoy fitness, discovering new things, and engaging in activities that contribute to my personal growth.

On this blog, I’ll be sharing my journey in software development along with other topics that interest me.

            <h1>My Values & Outlook on Life</h1>
            <p>My outlook on life is shaped by sincerity, hard work, and determination. I value being respectful, trustworthy, and genuine toward others. I believe that learning something new every day and constantly improving myself adds real value to my life. Challenges are part of the journey, but instead of giving up, I choose to learn from them. Looking to the future with hope and working with discipline toward my goals has become my life philosophy.</p>

            <h1>My Family</h1>
            <p>I come from a family of three siblings, and I am the youngest. Being the youngest sometimes means being spoiled, but it also means learning a lot from my older siblings. Growing up with them taught me how to share, support each other, and enjoy even the simplest moments together.
                Family has always been an important part of my life, and they have played a big role in shaping who I am today.</p>
